## About OpenStreetMap ##
OpenStreetMap creates and provides free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them. The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people from using them in creative, productive or unexpected ways.

## The API ##
OpenStreetMap exposes a fairly straightforward [RESTful API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/OSM_Protocol_Version_0.5) that allows simple CRUD operations on OpenStreetMap data objects, as well as batch retrieve operations and history retrieval. Modification operations require OpenStreetMap credentials. See the [main website](http://www.openstreetmap.org) for details.

## This Project ##
The aim of this project is to allow .NET developers to gain easy access to the OpenStreetMap data. It will expose the basic OpenStreetMap data objects, as well as all API calls. OpenStreetMap.NET is developed in Visual Studio 2008.

## Status ##
We are currently in pre-release. You can check out the alpha code, but don't expect it to actually do anything just yet.
